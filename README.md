What is Hacktoberfest? 🤔
A month-long celebration from October 1st to October 31st presented by Digital Ocean and DEV Community collaborated with GitHub to get people involved in Open Source. Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open-source developer community.

https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

Rules:

To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/) and make four Pull Requests (PRs) between October 1-31, 2022 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repository on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. This year, the first 40,000 participants who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
